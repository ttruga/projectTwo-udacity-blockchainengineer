# Blockchain Data

Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. Develop Blockchain skills by understanding the data model behind Blockchain by developing your own simplified private blockchain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Configuring your project

- Get all packages needed for the project
```
yarn install
```

## Testing

To test code:
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.
2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
```
node
```
3: Copy and paste the code contained inside `simpleChain.js` file into your node session
4: Instantiate blockchain with chain variable
```
let chain = new Blockchain();
```
5: Generate 10 blocks using a for loop
```
(function theLoop (i) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    chain.addBlock(new Block(`test block n: ${i}`))
    if (--i) theLoop(i);
  }, 100);
})(10);
```
6: Validate blockchain
```
chain.validateChain();
```
7: Induce errors by changing block data by first resetting the REPL, executing `node` again and pasting the following code, please first shut down the current `node` session and start a new one so the DB is not caught by the previous process
```
# first reset the node
const level = require('level');
const chainDB = './chaindata';
const db = level(chainDB);

db.get(3).then(block => {
  console.log(block);
  const modBlock =  JSON.parse(block);
  modBlock.body = 'this is a screw up body';
  return Promise.all([modBlock, db.del(3)]);
}).then(promises => {
  return db.put(3, JSON.stringify(promises[0]))
});
```
8: Clear the node session, start a new one, then execute steps 3 and 4 and validate blockchain again. The chain should now fail with block 3.
```
chain.validateChain();
```
